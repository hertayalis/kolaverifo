RIP to a legend. 2/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yk6eXrHgzh</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>He carefully establishes the timeline that the movie is set in, and points out some other little errors along the way that (for him) pale in comparison to a single glaring reference that Matt Damon's character makes that is so out of place in the Cameron Crowe movie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>First, he points out that the movie begins in February of 2010 as depicted by on-screen evidence showing a memorial plaque for a tiger that's passed away and a conversation over a meal between Damon's character and his brother (Haden Church) in the film.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we also know that the timeline of the film is condensed into a five-month period during which the zoo is bought and restored. we know this because Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) tells his brother that it is "currently February" and they will open the zoo by july. 3/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NbQp4lADL1</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we also know that the climactic zoo opening at the end of the film takes place, as mentioned, in july. 7/7, to be exact. they keep track on a cute little calendar. 4/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xQXaGTxdQF</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Zach then goes on to further delineate the movie's five-month-period timeline, showing the zoo opening date on the "cute calendar" to be July 7, 2010. Here's where the first continuity error pops up: July 7, 2010 takes place on a Wednesday (not a Saturday that the movie indicates), but this isn't what upsets Zach the most.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the thing that upsets me is not that, in reality, july 7th 2010 was a wednesday, not a saturday. i don't care about that. what pisses me off is a scene that takes place 45 minutes into the film. 5/</p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Zach's ire has everything to do with the Chilean mining accident that occurred on Aug. 5, 2010, when 33 individuals were holed up underground for a whopping 69 days. Thankfully, every single one of the miners was rescued which is wonderful news, but there's still the business of a particular date peculiarity to be dealt with.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>beginning august 5th, 2010, 33 chilean miners were trapped underground in the San José copper–gold mine, and remained stuck for 69 days. they were all eventually rescued in october. this became known as the Chilean mining accident. 6/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AsHNePkCSm</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Namely the fact that Matt Damon's character calls his daughter a Chilean miner, a clear reference to the mining accident, some 45 minutes into the movie.</p><p>Seeing as the film ends with the July 7, 2010 opening of the zoo, nearly a month before the mining accident, this means that in the We Bought a Zoo universe, there is really no reason why Matt Damon's character should be making that allusion.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>45 minutes into the film, Rosie Mee, Benjamin's daughter, is too warm in bed and insists on getting more fans, instead of getting rid of her pile of stuffed animals, blankets, and clothes. 8/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tvNeORuPei</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For Zach, this reference completely takes him out of the film and he wants to know: Was it a scripted line or an instance of Damon riffing? But he did do some digging to find out what could've influenced the reference: that particular scene was most likely filmed in September of 2010, and the Chilean miner story was the height of the global news cycle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>as we know, the events of the film take place no later than july 2010. it would be impossible for benjamin to have advance knowledge of the Chilean mining accident, which does not happen until august. 10/</p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>not only that, but at this point of the film, renovations have only barely begun, putting the events of this scene sometime around mid-spring. we aren't even in the same season as the accident. 11/</p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Zach's clearly perturbed by the incident and riffs on it throughout a series of tweets. He eventually discovers that the correct term he is looking for is an "anachronism" and not a continuity error, but the fact remains that Matt Damon's character referenced the Chilean mining accident well before it happened.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>it is possible that Benjamin was referencing generic "chilean miners," but he is specifically cracking wise at how buried Rosie is, and how difficult it will be to remove her from her pile of toys. as far as i'm aware, that association didn't exist until after the accident. 12/ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/63PHW3Pcut</a></p>— zach silberberg (@zachsilberberg) <a href=#>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>so here is what i must ask: was this line scripted?
