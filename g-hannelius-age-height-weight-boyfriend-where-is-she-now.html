That year, she appeared in the History Channel miniseries, where she played Missy Waller.&nbsp;However, her transition from Disney seems to be rather slow.&nbsp;Fans were excited when she booked the role of Christa Carlyle in the American television series Net Vollal Vandal, but she did not survive the first season of the series.</span></p><p><span>Although the actress remains active on social media, it looks like she’s taking an unofficial break from the industry.&nbsp;Fingers crossed, she gets back in the saddle as soon as possible!</span></p><h2><strong><span>Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Hannelius is already building his romantic relationship story.&nbsp;His first relationship with Media Media was with a certain Jack Chaite.&nbsp;Unlike G, Jack is not in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;The duo started dating in late 2015 and Chiate immediately became popular among G fans when photos of their homecoming date surfaced online.</span></p><p><span>The couple would soon go Instagram official and start sharing cute snaps of themselves.&nbsp;G brought him to one of the red carpet events to support his hit show, Dog with a Blog.&nbsp;In 2017, when Jack graduated from Calabasas High School, Hannelius showed up as his prom date.</span></p><p><span>However, things seemed to take a turn for the worse after this photo from the prom, as it became the last photo they posted of each other.&nbsp;While Jack enrolled at USC as part of the Class of 2021, Hannelius continued his career.</span></p><p><span>In July 2018, Hannelius seemed to have found new love.&nbsp;She posted a photo of herself with a certain mystery boy later discovered to be Barrett.&nbsp;As time passed, Instagram posts of the two confirmed their romance.&nbsp;Barrett graduated from Chatsworth Secondary School in 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Size weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Hannelius is short in stature, which makes his age a difficult question.&nbsp;The actress is 5ft 3in tall and weighs around 48kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifXZ2ur7rEpaCuq12WtKZ5x56goKCkYsSmtcahq2aan66zs7XEp5tmr5iav6Z5yKxkrKCVYruww44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fg-hannelius-age-height-weight-boyfriend-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./holly-west-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./holly-west-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Holly West Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./famous-faces-that-were-once-in-kidz-bop.html>Famous Faces That Were Once In Kidz Bop</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./famous-faces-that-were-once-in-kidz-bop.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
