<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Landry Fields is a college scout who made a name for himself in the National Basketball Association (NBA) after playing for the New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors before being forced into early retirement due to injury issues.&nbsp;However, he has continued to be part of the sport ever since.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Landry Fields?&nbsp;Biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>Fields was born on June 27, 1988 in Long Beach, California and was raised alongside 2 siblings by his parents, Steve and Janice Fields.</span></p><p><span>Throughout his life, Landry was always very close to basketball, so it’s no surprise to realize that he became very good at the game. It’s not just his father, Steve Fields, a A college basketball player when he was at the University of Miami, he also made the 1975 draft even though he was unable to appear in an NBA game.</span></p><p><span>The only thing that is more interesting than his father also playing in his youth is that his mother, Janice Fields was once a community college basketball player.&nbsp;A cousin of Cameron Jones, Landry also has members of his extended family who have played the sport.</span></p><p><span>For his education he went to Ellwood P. Cubberley Elementary School from where he proceeded to Stanford University where he continued to perform.&nbsp;Showcasing an outstanding performance, he was selected by the New York Knicks in the 2010 NBA draft.&nbsp;Prior to that, he made the All-Pac-10 first team and was named Pac-10 Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</span></p><p><span>At the end of his first season in the NBA, he earned the NBA All-Rookie First Team.&nbsp;Prior to that, he was the Rookie of the Month for November and December 2010 in the Eastern Conference.&nbsp;He remained with the Knickers until 2012 when he signed a three-year contract with the Toronto Raptors worth $20 million.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately for him, he couldn’t make it big with the Raptors as he continued to struggle with injuries.&nbsp;When his contract ended, he went for another surgery which ruled him out for five months.&nbsp;As a result, he sat out the 2015–16 season, marking the end of his career.&nbsp;Still, he remained close to sports as he was named a college scout by the San Antonio Spurs.</span></p><p><span>Apart from basketball, he has also made a few television appearances.&nbsp;In 2011, he was part of&nbsp;</span><span>The Andy and Landry Show</span><span>&nbsp;which he ran with his former bandmate, Andy Rautins.&nbsp;The show didn’t last a year before it ended.&nbsp;Then he took part in a reality show on the&nbsp;</span><span>Chante ton visage</span><span>&nbsp;in 2014, and together with Lisa Rinna, he was named a finalist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his wife?&nbsp;Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>If you’re wondering if the ex-NBA star has a girlfriend, he doesn’t.&nbsp;He has been married since 2014 to his supermodel girlfriend, Elaine Alden.</span></p><p><span>Elaine, born on February 11, 1987, was first linked to Landry Fields in 2012 while still playing for the New York Knicks.&nbsp;The ex-basketballer first spotted the woman who would become his wife during an electronic dance music show and thanks to being in a band with a mutual friend, the two were introduced , kicking off what was to come.&nbsp;to lead to something big.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the duo got engaged before becoming man and wife in 2014 at an event held on a rooftop overlooking a beautiful Gothic cathedral at Rockefeller Center.&nbsp;So far, the union has been blessed with two sons: Jackson James Fields, born a year before the couple married, and Kai David Fields, born in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Elaine Alden was a model before she got married and she appeared in some fitness videos but not much is known about her family or how she was raised.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>As a former basketball star, one of the things it’s easy to assume is that Landry Fields has an intimidating height.&nbsp;He deservedly has it as he stands at a huge height which measures 6 feet 6 inches (2.01m) and a body weight of 215 pounds (98 kg).</span></p><p class=postsid
