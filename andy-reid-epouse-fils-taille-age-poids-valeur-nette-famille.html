He first practised his expertise as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2012 and also served as the executive vice president of football operations for the Eagles. He is credited with leading the Eagles to five Football Conference (NFC) championship games and a Super Bowl appearance in 2004.</span></p><p><strong>Early Life</strong><br>Born on March 19, 1958, in Los Angeles, California, Andy Reid displayed a passion for football from a young age. He attended John Marshall High School and worked as a vendor at Dodger Stadium during his teenage years. His early sports involvement included playing in youth leagues under coach Pete Arbogast. A notable childhood moment was his participation in the “Punt, Pass, and Kick” competition on Monday Night Football at the age of 13​​.</p><p><strong>Coaching Career: College and Early Years</strong><br>Reid’s coaching career had its roots at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he spent a year as a graduate assistant after graduating in 1981. He then served as an offensive line coach at several colleges, including San Francisco Gators and Northern Arizona University, where he coached Frank Pollack, who later played for the San Francisco 49ers​​.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles Era</strong><br>Reid’s big break came with the Philadelphia Eagles. Hired in 1999 following the Eagles’ poor performance in the previous season, Reid’s meticulous approach to football and detailed planning were key factors in his appointment. Under his leadership, the Eagles transformed into a dominant force, reaching five NFC Championship Games and making an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX. Reid also served as the executive vice president of football operations, effectively acting as the general manager from 2001. Despite his success, the Eagles missed the playoffs in 2011 and 2012, leading to his departure​​​​.</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs: A Resurgence</strong><br>In 2013, Reid took over as the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, quickly turning around a struggling franchise. His tenure with the Chiefs has been marked by significant achievements, including nine postseason appearances, seven consecutive division titles, five AFC Championship Games, three Super Bowl appearances, and two wins in Super Bowls LIV and LVII. Reid’s leadership has been integral to the Chiefs’ success, including their strong regular season in 2016 and back-to-back AFC West titles in 2017​​.</p><p><strong>Personal Life</strong><br>Reid’s personal life has seen its share of both joy and tragedy. He married Tammy Reid in 1983, with whom he has five children. The family faced a devastating loss with the passing of their eldest son, Garrett, in 2012​​.</p><p>Through ups and downs, Reid’s career stands as a testament to his expertise, resilience, and influence in American football, marking him as one of the sport’s most respected figures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnpnGbr7EoptmnaCkwrSxjJ%2Bgpatdqa6quMueZJqflWK9sLXDrGSvmZyawrN5zZ6rrZ1dm66utculnGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandy-reid-epouse-fils-taille-age-poids-valeur-nette-famille.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aron-kader-net-worth-288685.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aron-kader-net-worth-288685.html>Aron Kader Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heather-young-meet-tarek-by-chance.html>Heather Young admits she has chills over how she met Tarek by chance Thu 16 March 2</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heather-young-meet-tarek-by-chance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
