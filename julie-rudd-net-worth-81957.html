Then he'd come off and ask me for observations. And he was totally serious about it. One night I asked him about all the tape marks all over the floor when he sang. And he asked the lighting guy to bring up the lights one by one and I saw how they 'hit the marks'. Frank just walked over to me and explained how lighting will enhance musical moments".</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1968</span><p>Budd began her singing career at the age of 12, taking the stage for amateur night at the Tamarack resort camp in the Catskills. There she was spotted by <a href=#>Producer</a> Herb Bernstein, who became her personal manager and arranger. He continued to work with her through the next thirty years. After signing a contract for personal management, he also had her record a demo, signed her to a three-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and sent her to a voice coach. One of Bernstein's employees suggested her new stage name. Budd appeared on the <i>Merv Griffin Show</i>, <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>, <i>The Tonight Show</i>, and <i>The Jim Nabors Hour</i>. In 1968 she released the LP <i>Child of Plenty</i> on the MGM label and became a regular on the NBC TV summer series <i>Showcase '68</i>.</p><span>1969</span><p>She was born Edith Erdman in Brooklyn, New York, the second of three daughters of Saul and Joan Erdman. Her father was a bottling company executive. Her family was Jewish but not religious. She attended the Roy H. Mann Jr. High School in Brooklyn until 1969, when she transferred to a private academy in Manhattan. In 1993 she contributed her reminiscences of growing up in Brooklyn to the book <i>It Happened in Brooklyn: An oral history of growing up in the borough in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s</i> (1993).</p><span>1972</span><p>She performed the title song for the 1972 film <i>Living Free</i>, which played over the opening credits.

A 1981 <i>New York Magazine</i> article noted that she had "sung in public for 15 of her 27 years", and "almost had the lead in <i>Evita</i> on Broadway".</p><span>1981</span><p>In acting, Budd is associated with the Circle Repertory Theater and Playwright's Horizons of New York City. She starred in the 1981 Walt Disney film <i>The Devil and Max Devlin</i> as a 19-year-old high school dropout and aspiring singer.

At Disney they always do it right".</p><span>1991</span><p>In November 1991 she teamed with Burns again to put on a benefit performance to raise funds for the Children's Hospital of Orange County.
