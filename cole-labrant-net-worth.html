Cole and Sav tried to control the damage by changing the video’s thumbnail and title. But people already had screenshots of their mischievous prank as evidence. The original title was “A giant fire makes us evacuate our house.” The altered one was, “We left our house because of fires in California.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They came under fire on another occasion when they did a cruel prank on Everleigh.</span></p><h4>Read Also:&nbsp;<span style=color:#00f><a style=color:#00f href=# rel=bookmark>Hitmaka Net Worth: How Rich Is The Rapper Actually In 2022?</a></span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>They decided to play an April Fool’s Day prank on the poor child, Everleigh, but it backfired enormously.
