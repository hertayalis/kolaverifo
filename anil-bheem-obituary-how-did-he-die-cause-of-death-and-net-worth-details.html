Anil has shielded his family from public view. Because of this, virtually little is known about his family. He is survived by his mother Pramatee Bheem, wife Cheryl, daughters Neelun Bheem and Prithivi Bheem, as well as grandchildren.</p><p>We deliver the news that our dear Anil Bheem died away this morning with sorrowful hearts, and they are still processing it, 103.1 FM tweeted. The radio station sent its condolences to his wife Cheryl, daughters, family, friends, coworkers in the business, and supporters. Reportedly, Prematee Bheem, a well-known local singer, is Anil’s mother, and during his free time, her son used to practise singing at the studio. According to reports, the singer passed away on February 4 at his house in Curepe, the morning following a performance the previous evening.</p><p>Anil Bheem began his professional life in 1993 as a technical operator at 103FM, Trinidad and Tobago’s first station dedicated exclusively to Indian music. Typically, Kumar Sanu, India’s renowned playback singer, served as the vocalist for Anil’s renditions of popular Bollywood songs.</p><h2><span id=Value_of_Anil_Bheem_at_the_Time_of_His_Death>Value of Anil Bheem at the Time of His Death</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Anil Bheem’s net worth is anticipated to be at <strong>$1 million.</strong> The radio host worked at 103.1 FM in the afternoons and hosted the well-liked drivetime program Catch the Rhythms.
