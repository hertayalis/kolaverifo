At the peak of his career in the late 1990s, he was the highest-paid actor in the world. He negotiated a $20 million salary for the sequel to the first “Rush Hour” movie in 1999, which would be equivalent to earning $40 million for a single movie in today’s dollars.</p><p>Furthermore, Tucker negotiated a two-movie $40 million contract with New Line Cinema, of which $25 million would be his salary for Rush Hour 3. He also received 20% of the gross receipts from the movie. From his work in the Rush Hour franchise alone, Chris earned at least $50 million, which would be roughly $65 million after adjusting for inflation.</p><h2><span id=Financial_Setbacks_for_Chris_Tucker>Financial Setbacks for Chris Tucker</span></h2><p>Chris Tucker’s net worth has suffered due to a series of financial mistakes over the years. In 2011, he found himself in significant debt to the IRS, owing $11 million in taxes for the years 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005. By 2014, the debt had risen to $14 million.</p><p>Tucker’s tax debt was finally settled in 2014, but it undoubtedly had a significant impact on his net worth.

At the time of the 2011 filing, Chris stated publicly that he did not have enough income to pay his bills.</p><p>In 2013, Chris sold a 6,399 square foot home in Tarzana, California for $2.1 million. He bought this home in November 1996 for $1.1 million. In 2001 he paid $2.4 million for the home next door. He sold this home in 2009 for $3 million.
